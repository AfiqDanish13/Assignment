## Problems Encountered & Solutions

- problem we faced is when characters hitting the borders, the code will show error that indicates that it can go beyond it. We solve it by making the movement always stop before reach the borders.
- We always faced errors that related to the Alien's coordinate. We solve it by paying attention to the code that related to the coordinate adjustments and try to synchronize it with the output that we want.
